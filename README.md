This repository is still under prepration.
 
Required operating enviroment
 
Matlab 2012b.  The code probably runs on earlier versions, 
but we have not checked extensively.

 
The code also requires three toolboxes you can download freely:

 1) vistasoft (Wandell Lab., Stanford)
   https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft

 2) LIFE (Franco Pestilli, Indiana University)
   https://github.com/francopestilli/life

 3) MBA (Franco Pestilli, Indiana University)
   https://github.com/francopestilli/mba

 4) AFQ (Jason D. Yeatman, Stanford)
   https://github.com/jyeatman/AFQ

All of this software must be on your path. 

If you use this software please cite the article above.
